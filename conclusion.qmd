# Conclusion

The underlying recommender model employs a collaborative filtering approach by using user ratings to infer preferences and generate recommendations. The Interactive Graph screen provides insights into a user's historical ratings and the model's recommended movies for that user.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

User Selection: Allows the user interface to select a specific user profile.

Top 10 Rated Movies: Displays the top 10 movies that the selected user has previously rated. This information helps visualize the user's preferences and the types of movies they tend to like based on their historical ratings.

Recommended Movies: Shows the top 10 movies recommended by the model specifically for the selected user. These recommendations are generated by analyzing the user's past ratings and possibly by comparing their preferences with other users to suggest movies they might enjoy but haven't rated yet.

The system utilizes both historical user data (ratings) and a recommendation algorithm to offer personalized movie suggestions. This approach often falls into collaborative filtering, where the system identifies patterns and similarities among users' preferences to make predictions about what a particular user might like.
